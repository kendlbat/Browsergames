# Browsergames
I had the idea to code a few browsergames for fun to enjoy programming a little.
These games are available publicly and licensed under the [MIT-License](https://browsergames.pages.dev/#license)
You may use these as a base for your own project and have some fun too.
If you want to learn how I made these, check out my public [JavaScript Tutorial](https://wmc-groupwork.pages.dev)!
